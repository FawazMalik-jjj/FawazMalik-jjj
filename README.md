"👋 Hi there! I'm Fawaz Malik, a passionate cloud engineer and a blockchain enthusiast with expertise in smart contracts. 💡 My mission is to revolutionize the digital world by leveraging the power of decentralized technologies. 🌐 I specialize in developing smart contracts on various blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum, and enjoy building decentralized applications (DApps) that empower users with trust, transparency, and autonomy. I have worked as a Blockchain DevOps Engineer at Dandelion Networks, where I was directly involved in developing, testing, and implementing the DDLN [Distributed Decentralized Lattice Network] testnet. 

🔭 As a blockchain Web3 developer, I constantly explore emerging trends and technologies in the decentralized space, staying up-to-date with the latest advancements. 📚 My skill set includes Solidity, Truffle, Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), and web3.js, among others. I strive to write clean, efficient, and secure code to ensure the integrity of smart contracts and DApps.

☁️ As a Multi-cloud engineer, I have got my hands on AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud platform, worked on AI-driven platforms, integrating a stack of tools and technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, CI-CD Pipelines on Jenkins. I have had an experience leading a team of backend engineers to deploy an AI-driven platform on the cloud and manage backend databases such as Firebase. My recent cloud security projects involved building Secure File Vault and Cloud security scouting


🌱 I am always eager to collaborate and work on innovative projects in the blockchain space. If you're looking to build decentralized solutions or need assistance with smart contracts, feel free to reach out. Let's revolutionize the world together! 🚀"
