"👋 Hi there! I'm Fawaz Malik, a passionate blockchain enthusiast and Web3 developer with expertise in smart contracts. 💡 My mission is to revolutionize the digital world by leveraging the power of decentralized technologies. 🌐 I specialize in developing smart contracts on various blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum, and enjoy building decentralized applications (DApps) that empower users with trust, transparency, and autonomy. I have worked as a Blockchain DevOps Engineer at Dandelion Networks directly involved in the development, testing, and implementation of the DDLN [Distributed Decentralized Lattice Network] testnet. I am currently working as a cloud backend engineer at Bizbridge, a platform enabling a seamless and smooth transition of business ownership, wealth, and exit strategy.    

🔭 As a blockchain Web3 developer, I constantly explore emerging trends and technologies in the decentralized space, staying up-to-date with the latest advancements. 📚 My skill set includes Solidity, Truffle, Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), and web3.js, among others. I strive to write clean, efficient, and secure code to ensure the integrity of smart contracts and DApps.

🌱 I am always eager to collaborate and work on innovative projects in the blockchain space. If you're looking to build decentralized solutions or need assistance with smart contracts, feel free to reach out. Let's revolutionize the world together! 🚀"
